    indices for a time series data set. This is useful for autoregressive
    models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas dataframe
        Orginal dataset we want to build lag data set from.
    n_lags : int
        Number of lags. ``n_lags=1`` means only the original data set. Must be
        >= 1.
    stride : int
        Stride of the lags. For instance, ``stride=2`` means only even lags.
    features : array_like
        List of columns to include in the lags data. All columns are retained
        for lag 0. For data frames containing features and targets, the
        features (inputs)  can be placed in `features` so the targets (outputs)
        are only present for lag 0. If None, use all columns.

    -------

        New data frame where lags data frames have been concat'ed tegether.
        The columns are a new hierarchical index with the lag at the lowest
        level.

    --------
